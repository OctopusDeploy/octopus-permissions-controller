                  - "Progressing": the resource is being created or updated
                  - "Degraded": the resource failed to reach or maintain its desired state

                  Standard condition types include:

                  - "Progressing": the resource is being created or updated
                  - "Degraded": the resource failed to reach or maintain its desired state
